/*
Package hangulize provides an automatic transcriber into Hangul for non-Korean
words.

Originally, Hangulize was implemented in Python in 2010.  This implementation
is a reboot with attractive feature improvements.

Original implementation: https://github.com/sublee/hangulize

Brian Jongseong Park proposed the seed idea of Hangulize on his Blog.

//    Hangulize("ita", "gloria")
//    // Output: "글로리아"

func Hangulize(lang string, word string) string {
	// TODO(sublee): implement
	// Hard coded to pass test.
	return "글로리아"
